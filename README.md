# AI-Detection-Robot

By using this thesis and based on experimental results we are able to detect objects more precisely
and identify the objects individually with exact location of an object in the picture in x,y axis.This
paper also provides experimental results on different methods for object detection and
identification and compares each method for their efficiencie
